# Manually create webhook

Additionally to creating webhooks via the Box APIs it is possible to
create  webhooks via the developer console manually. This process is
often referred to as Webhooks V1.

## Restrictions

Webhooks created using the developer console will monitor changes to all
files and folders within a user's account. When creating one of these webhooks
it is not possible specify a specific object to bind the webhook to.

To create a webhook for a single file or folder please use the
[webhook APIs][create_webhook].

<Message type='warning'>

Webhooks created through this process will not show when listing
[all webhooks][list_webhooks] for a user.
