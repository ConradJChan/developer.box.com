    title: About variants
    description: |-
      This resource has 3 variations that can be returned by the API,
      depending on the endpoint used, and the usage of the `fields`
      parameter.

      The `mini` variant is often used when the
      resource is nested within another resource. For example, the
      mini variant of a `User` is often nested within other resources
      to represent the ownership of an item.

      The `standard` variant represents the  default set of attributes
      that are returned for this resource when requesting it via the API.
      For example. when retrieving a `File` resource by ID, it will return
      these fields by default.

      The `full` variant represents all the attributes that can be
      requested by API endpoints that support the `fields` parameter. For
      example, by defining the `fields` parameter as `id,type` when requesting
      a `File` by ID, only those fields will be returned in the API response.

    Welcome to our updated developer documentation, which
    is still very much a work in progress. For now it only
    contains our reference documentation while we work on
    moving more of our documentation over to this site.
