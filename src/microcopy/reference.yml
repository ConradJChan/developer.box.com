    Variations
    ==========

    This resource has 3 variations that can be encountered when
    using the API.

    * The `mini` variant is used when the resource is nested within the
      response for another resource. For example, the mini variant of a
      `User` is often nested within other resources to represent
      ownership of an item.

    * The `standard` variant represents the  default set of attributes
      that are returned requesting the resource it via its API endpoints.
      For example. when retrieving a `File` by ID, it will return
      these the `standard` fields by default, unless the `fields`
      request parameter has been specified.

    * The `full` variant represents all the attributes that can be
      requested by API endpoints that support the `fields` parameter.
      For example, by defining the `fields` request parameter as
      `id,type` when requesting a `File` by ID, only those fields will
      be returned in the API response.
